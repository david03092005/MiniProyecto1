**TRAILER: Wolfs**

The trailer corresponds to an upcoming film that blends the genres of comedy and action. In this project, we have decided to implement a change of direction, transitioning from humor to an atmosphere of horror and suspense.

From the outset of the editing process, several segments of the original script were modified to ensure that the shift to the horror genre was more coherent. All the dialogues were generated by one of the team members in collaboration with an artificial intelligence application, allowing each actor to have a distinctive voice.

- The voices generated for the dialogues underwent a tone reduction process to better align with the vocal characteristics of the characters present in the trailer.

- One of the initial dialogues was processed with a call filter, creating the auditory effect of a conversation over a mobile phone.

- In the final part of the phone dialogue, three additional soundtracks were incorporated, with altered low tones to produce a terrifying voice effect.

As we progressed in the editing, necessary sound adjustments were made to ensure that the trailer aligns with the intended atmosphere.
The following sound elements were incorporated:

- Suspense and tension
- Screams
- Gunshots

Each of the aforementioned sounds was processed with a surround effect to better fit the events occurring in the trailer video. Each of these sound elements was adjusted with a surround effect to enhance coherence with the actions and dynamics unfolding in the trailer.
